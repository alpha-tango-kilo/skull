//! # What is Skull?
//!
//! Skull is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played
//! in the players' heads.
//! Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more
//! card â€“ until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number
//! of cards face up and get only roses.
//! Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards
//! face up.
//! The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting
//! with his own.
//! If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing
//! one of his cards out of play.
//! Two successful challenges wins the game.
//! Skull is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.
//!
//! (Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his
//! [Ideal Game Library](http://www.faidutti.com/index.php?Module=ludotheque&id=728))
//!
//! ## How do I play Skull?
//!
//! Here's the [game's manual](http://www.skull-and-roses.com/pdf/Skull_EnP.pdf)
//! (in English)
//!
//! # What does this crate provide?
//!
//! This crate provides a **simulation** of the game Skull.
//! It allows for the creation of a [`Game`] for 3 to 6 players (as recommended
//! by the original) and provides all necessary means to interact with the
//! game and understand the current state of the game.
//! It enforces all of the games rules and scoring for you, so you only need
//! to focus on how you wish to present the game.
//!
//! Please note the documentation has been written on the assumption of an
//! understanding of the way Skull works.
//! If you don't know, it is highly recommended to read the manual and play the
//! game at least once to grasp it.
//!
