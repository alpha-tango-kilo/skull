# Skull

A Rust implementation of the card game [Skull](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/92415/skull)

The implementation is designed to be interface-agnostic, meaning that the `game` workspace provides the types and logic required to simulate the game but does not provide any means by which to prompt or take responses, these are instead expected to be provided by another means

## Roadmap

Version 1: Working CLI implementation of the game

Version 2: Network/Online play

Version 3: GUI (don't expect me to ever get to this)
